# South Asian Union
This is an open source repository detailing a theoretical and a wishful union of south asian countries - a non-existent (yet) collective of south asian countries that will flourish economically, culturally and socially.

## The Problem

"Indian and Pakistani leaders continue to suffer from the megalomania of the post-partition conflict and vested interests. They have not looked  past  petty  local  politics,  or  understand  that  without regional  cooperation,  peace  and  stability,  their  countries could not survive the growing trend towards globalization or realize  their  economic  potentials. I  could  not  comprehend why they were bent on destroying their economies with ever-increasing  military  expenditures,  to  the  detriment  of  their poverty-stricken people. Why did they not join hands and use the subcontinent’s immense potential and resources to make South Asia a major economic power in the world"
— The Sasia Story [Madanjeet Singh (UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madanjeet_Singh)

## The Idea

There can be are many ideas directed on "how to", justifications, implementation, and nitty-gritties toward creation of South Asian Union and this repository merely aims to just document them. Feel free to edit this document and create a pull request with your own ideas. If any of these ideas are successfully implemented, do create a pull request to let the community know with a link to more resources.

## Purpose of this document

This repository will compile the ideas and related documents to enable creation of, promotion for and lobbying towards of South Asian Union . This being a public and open source project itself shows that this is a people's project and only stakeholders, i.e. people will be able to execute it. This should not be taken as a political movement or agenda (Though whoever uses it for their political agenda is rightly able to do so under the license terms of this repository). This document will also indicate the current status of the idea, its origin etc. 

## Why on Github?

History and rapid growth of open source technologies on which our lives depend on nowadays shows the power and success of an open sourced software. My idea is that it can also be applied to textual document like this. People contribute because they are incentivized due to open nature of the platform as their contribution are well-documented. Moreover a lively discussion can take place over Issues tab in this repository.

  ## ‘peace  pipeline’
  - Initially Announced in SAARC; Current status: unknown. A Quote from The Sasia Story :- [Madanjeet Singh, The Sasia Story](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000138847/PDF/138847eng.pdf.multi) ‘peace  pipeline’ that  would  originate from Iran’s South Pars gas field and traverse south-western Pakistan  to  the  India  border,  bringing  gas  to  the  energy-starved Indian subcontinent. Natural gas is the cleanest fos-sil  fuel,  and  a  steady  supply  of  it  in  the  region  would  helpslow  carbon  emissions  that  would  otherwise  contribute  toglobal warming. This economically necessary, environmen-tally  friendly  and  security  enhancing  $4  billion  win-win  initiative would be the most economical way to get natural gasfrom  the  Gulf  to  India,  providing  Pakistan  annually  with $600  million  to  $700  million  in  transit  fees,  which  wouldalsocreate  jobs  in  the  restless  regions  of  Baluchistan  andSindh. This stand-alone project – like the integration of thecoal  and  steel  industries  of  Western  Europe,  which  sowed the  seeds  of  the  European  Economic  Union  –  shallinevitably  lead  to  the  South  Asian  Economic  Union,  hope-fully using the Sasia as the common currency. [Idea: Previous regimes of the countries involved]

## A Common Currency - Sasia

  - Sasia  mayhelp to promote stability, peace and communal harmony in South  Asia [Idea: Madanjeet Singh, The Sasia Story] 
  - Status: Not started

## A Cryptocurrentcy called Sasia 

  - Success of cryptocurrency has shown that people with vested interest' mentioned above can be sidelined. A cryptocurrency can easily bring people of south countries together in peace and harmony. [Idea: Tariq Abdullah]
